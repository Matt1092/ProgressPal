# ProgressPal
My Progress Pal
Full-stack web application I developed through Python's Django backend framework
Allows users to register and login using Django's built in user authentication framework
Users can create and update completion status on tasks and track their progress through different time intervals (weekly, monthly, yearly, etc.)
Allows users to track progression over time and give them something to be happy about (only if the graph is going up of course ;) )
